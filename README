= EZTime 

EZTime is a simple extension to the Date class in Ruby to provide easy
formatting of dates and times.

== Can't I just use strftime? 

=== Feature Support

EZTime has a number of formatting features not available to strftime. 
For example, what if you want to display the ordinal (st, nd, rd, th)
for a date?  (i.e. 1st, 2nd, etc.)  With EZTime, ordinals are easy.

How about displaying the meridian (AM/PM) in lowercase?  What about 
only displaying the first letter (a/p)?  While strftime is powerful,
there are simply some formatting options not available, which is a 
shame.

=== Simplicity

EZTime is much easier to use than strftime because it doesn't require
much memorization.  For example, isn't ":month/:day/:year" easier than
"%m/%d/%Y"?  Not convinced?  How about ":day:ordinal of :month_name, :year" 
(i.e. 20th of December, 2003).

=== Extensibility

Perhaps the strongest feature of EZTime is that it can be "extended" by simply
adding new methods to the Date class.  The reason this works is because EZTime
eval's the formatting string after a simple substitution, replacing the :name 
with a method call to that name.  The upside to this is that everything you put
in the formatting string can be accessed by itself as a method call.
